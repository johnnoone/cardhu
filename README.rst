cardhu
======

Setup tools extension, that can talks distutils2 setup.cfg, pip requirements file ...


Goals:

- use distutils2 setup.cfg files
- python setup.py install will find and use the first of these files:
    1. requirements-{target_version}.txt
    2. requirements.txt
- python setup.py develop will find and use the first of these files:
    1. requirements-dev-{target_version}.txt
    2. requirements-dev.txt
- python setup.py test will find and use the first of these files:
    1. requirements-test-{target_version}.txt
    2. requirements-test.txt
- extends the -r keyword to git and mercurial in order to create the last revision number (https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#tagging-and-daily-build-or-snapshot-releases)

Incompatibilities:

- distutils2 do not support extra_require keyword (https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies)


Currently implemented:

- some of the distutils2 keywords
- entry_points backport from distutils::

    [entry_points]
    distutils.setup_keywords =
      cardhu = cardhu.core:cardhu



Usage
-----


In your setup.py, the only requirement is::

    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        setup_requires=['cardhu'],
        cardhu=True
    )

And then your setup.cfg must be like this::

    [metadata]
    name = cardhu
    version = 0.1.1
    author = Xavier Barbosa
    summary = Allows using distutils2-like setup.cfg files for a package's metadata
     with a distribute/setuptools setup.py
    keywords =
        setup
        distutils
    [files]
    packages = cardhu
