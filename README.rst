cardhu
======

Setup tools extension, that can talks Distutils2_ setup.cfg, pip requirements file ...
This project is largely inspired by the d2to1_ library.

Usage
-----


In your setup.py, the only requirement is::

    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        setup_requires=['cardhu'],
        cardhu=True
    )

And then your setup.cfg must be like this::

    [metadata]
    name = cardhu
    version = 0.1.1
    author = Xavier Barbosa
    summary = Allows using distutils2-like setup.cfg files for a package's metadata
     with a distribute/setuptools setup.py
    keywords =
        setup
        distutils
    [files]
    packages = cardhu


Implementation
--------------

**Goals:**

-   use Distutils2_ `setup.cfg`_ files
-   python setup.py install will find and use the first of these files

    1.  requirements-{target_version}.txt
    2.  requirements.txt

-   python setup.py develop will find and use the first of these files

    1.  requirements-dev-{target_version}.txt
    2.  requirements-dev.txt

-   python setup.py test will find and use the first of these files

    1.  requirements-test-{target_version}.txt
    2.  requirements-test.txt

-   extends the -r keyword to git and mercurial in order to create the last revision number (https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#tagging-and-daily-build-or-snapshot-releases)


**Incompatibilities:**

-   distutils2 do not support extra_require keyword (https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies)
-   Options with `environment markers`_ are not implemented yet.


**Currently implemented:**

-   some of the distutils2 keywords
-   ``entry_points`` backport from distutils::

        [entry_points]
        distutils.setup_keywords =
          cardhu = cardhu.core:cardhu

-   setup(cardhu=True) will loads distutils2 setup.cfg parts
-   Command hooks: https://pythonhosted.org/Distutils2/distutils/commandhooks.html::

        # file: myhooks.py
        def my_install_hook(install_cmd):
            print("Oh la la! Someone is installing my project!")
    
    ::

        [install]
        pre-hook.project = myhooks.my_install_hook
